// In exam.js file:
// ● write a constructor function with three arguments that represent a subject, a student, and a grade.
// ● add to its prototype a method getExamInfo that returns the name of the subject and the name and surname of the student.
// ● add to its prototype a method hasPassed that checks if the student has passed the exam. A student has passed the exam if their grade is greater than 5.
